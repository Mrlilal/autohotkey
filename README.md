# Personal AutoHotKey Scripts 

## ban_all_bots  
With this script, you can ban all bots that are on the list. If you use the AHK file, you can also add your own to it.  
Most bots in this script are from a document that I found found from [MatchaArtist](https://www.twitch.tv/matchaartist) and their moderation team, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_F3qKiwkECmHYJvHv4hevkOYWundzNewpC_PcSGBj1I/edit).

### Instructions 
1. Run the script.
2. Focus your mouse onto the text area that the script will by typing in. This would be either the chat portion of Twitch in a browser, or the input area on your chat program.
3. Press the keybinds to start the process of the script typing in all bots to ban.
4. Wait until the thread is done typing.

## FAQ  
### What is AutoHotKey?  
AutoHotKey is essentially a free program that allows you to emulate key presses, mouse movements, and probably other things that I haven't used it for. You assign keybinds to whichever action you'd like to do, and bim-bam-boom, it's done. Here are a few quotes from the [website](https://www.autohotkey.com/) that may help you understand:
> Define hotkeys for the mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons and autocorrect-like replacements. Creating simple hotkeys has never been easier; you can do it in just a few lines or less!  

> AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc.   

### How do I download AutoHotKey?  
You can download AutoHotKey from their website, [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).  

### How do I use these scripts?  
Firstly, install AutoHotKey if you haven't already.  
To use one of these scripts, you can run it one of two ways.  
- Run the AHK file. On Windows, the easiest ways would be to either double-click the file or to right-click -> Run.  
- Run the EXE file. On Windows, the wasiest ways would be to either double-click the file or to right-click -> Open.  

You can learn more about running an AutoHotKey script from their website, [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Program.htm#run).  

### What is the difference between an AHK and an EXE?  
The AHK file is essentially the raw file that's also executable. This is what allows you to actually create a script and edit it. This is the file that most people would probably want to use.  
The EXE file is just an executable. It's the compiled version of the AHK. It offers no performance increase.
